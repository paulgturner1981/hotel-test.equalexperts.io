Testing Completed
-----------------

Cross-browser/device testing:
-----------------------------
Exploratory testing completed in the folowing browsers: Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest), Safari (latest).
As the site does not work correctly below 991px width I decided it was not relevant to spend time testing on devices until this issue was resolved. Should that defect be resolved device testing will be required.

Accessibility testing:
----------------------
Manual testing of keyboard tabbing and voiceover.
Also ran an "Axe" test, an "Accessibility Insights for Web" test, and a "Lighthouse" accessibiilty test.

Security testing:
-----------------
I used OSAWP ZAP to complete a security scan. The results of the scan are attached to the project. Defects discovered have also been added to the attached defect report.

Performance testing:
-------------------
As this is a shared live site I decided it would not be sensible to run load testing against the site.
I did however run Lighthouse performance tests and have attached the results to this project.

All defects discovered thus far in my testing have been consolidated in the attached Defect Report.
